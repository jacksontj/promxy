QueryRange -- only cache matrix responses
    - break the time into chunks, merge chunks together to respond

Step normalization
    normalize to the step
	    // Align start/end to step boundaries
	    start = (start / stepMS) * stepMS
	    end = ((end / stepMS) * stepMS)

FastForward
    - stitch most recent data (vector) onto the end of the matrix response
